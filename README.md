# love-sandwiches

## Welcome to the Python Essentials walkthrough project!

### This project is designed to consolidate the Python concepts I've learned so far.
It's designed to demonstrate how Python works in a real-world context.
The project is a command line based program to handle data automation for a fictional sandwich company.
Love Sandwiches runs a local market stall, selling  a small range of sandwiches.
For each market day, their staff pre-make stock to sell. If they sell out of a particular sandwich, their staff make extra for their customers. The unsold ones are thrown away at the end of the day.
I want a Python program that will collect the companyâ€™s market day sales data,
calculate the surplus for the day, and produce recommendations for the number of each sandwich to make for the next market. The goal is to save the company staff time by automating a repetitive task, and help reduce the surplus by better predicting sales for future markets.
To achieve this, I wired up my Python program to interact with a Google Sheet, so that I can push and pull data to and from the spreadsheet.

Along the way I became comfortable with Python functions and improved my understanding of how to build a command-line application in Python.
Thirdly, I learnt how to set up a Google Sheets API to send and receive data to an external application. Finally i learnt how to refactor code to streamline my projects and reduce repetition.
